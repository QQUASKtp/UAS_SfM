about=This plugin uses the QT menus from the MicMac library to allow GUI-based Structure from Motion processing in a Geospatial context. The MicMac QT menus are pre-written and will require MicMac to compiled and installed separately. This plugin calls those GUI commands directly for all of the menu options.
